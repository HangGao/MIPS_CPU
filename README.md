# MIPS Instruction Set Based CPU

This is an implementation for a simplified MIPS CPU using high level programming language. The considered simulator 
adopts a multi-cycle pipline processor to dynamically schedule instruction execution and employs caches in order to 
dynamically schedule instruction execution and employs caches in order to expedite memory access.
